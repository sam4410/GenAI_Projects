Building a RAG based chatbot system using a hypothetical hospital system data available in public domain. I have added an additional file for incorporating text based "Reviews" data. 
This RAG solution is aimed at building a chatbot for business leaders which can answer to their subjective, for e.g. At which hospital patients are complaining about billing? as well as objective, 
for e.g. what is the total billing amount in year 2012 from Atena (insurance payer) company? kind of questions by querying using natural language.

The solution leverages the following technological components:

Python >= 3.10
Neo4j Aura DB
Fast API
Streamlit for UI
Langchain Framework
OpenAI API key
